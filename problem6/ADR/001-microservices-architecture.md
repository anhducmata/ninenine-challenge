# ADR-001: Microservices Architecture for Live Scoreboard System

## Status
Accepted

## Date
2025-07-17

## Context
We need to design a scalable, maintainable system for a live scoreboard that handles real-time score updates, user authentication, and live broadcasting to multiple users. The system must prevent score manipulation while providing excellent performance.

## Decision
We have decided to implement a microservices architecture with the following components:
- **API Server**: Core business logic and score management
- **Auth Service**: Dedicated authentication and authorization
- **WebSocket Server**: Real-time communication handling
- **Database**: Persistent data storage
- **Redis Cache**: High-performance caching layer

## Rationale
1. **Separation of Concerns**: Each service has a single responsibility
2. **Scalability**: Services can be scaled independently based on load
3. **Technology Flexibility**: Different services can use optimal technologies
4. **Fault Isolation**: Failure in one service doesn't bring down the entire system
5. **Team Autonomy**: Different teams can own and develop services independently

## Consequences

### Positive
- Independent scaling of authentication vs. real-time features
- Better fault tolerance and system resilience
- Easier maintenance and updates
- Technology diversity allows optimal tool selection
- Clear service boundaries improve code organization

### Negative
- Increased system complexity
- Network latency between services
- Distributed system challenges (consistency, monitoring)
- More deployment and operational overhead
- Inter-service communication needs careful design

## Alternatives Considered
1. **Monolithic Architecture**: Simpler but less scalable
2. **Serverless Functions**: Good for specific use cases but complex state management
3. **Event-Driven Architecture**: Considered but adds complexity for real-time requirements

## Implementation Notes
- Use REST APIs for synchronous communication
- Implement proper service discovery
- Add circuit breakers for resilience
- Comprehensive monitoring across all services
- Consistent error handling and logging
