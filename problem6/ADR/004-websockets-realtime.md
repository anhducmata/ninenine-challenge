# ADR-004: WebSockets for Real-time Communication

## Status
Accepted

## Date
2025-07-17

## Context
The live scoreboard system requires real-time updates to all connected users when scores change. Traditional HTTP polling would be inefficient and provide poor user experience with delays and high server load.

## Decision
We have decided to implement WebSockets for real-time bidirectional communication between the server and connected clients.

## Rationale
1. **Real-time Updates**: Instant score updates without polling
2. **Efficiency**: Single persistent connection vs. multiple HTTP requests
3. **Low Latency**: Direct push notifications to clients
4. **Bidirectional**: Supports both server-to-client and client-to-server communication
5. **Scalability**: More efficient than HTTP polling for concurrent users
6. **User Experience**: Immediate visual feedback and live updates

## Consequences

### Positive
- Immediate real-time updates across all connected users
- Reduced server load compared to HTTP polling
- Better user experience with live score changes
- Efficient bandwidth usage
- Support for connection state management
- Enables advanced features like live chat or notifications

### Negative
- More complex connection management
- Persistent connections consume server resources
- Requires graceful handling of connection drops
- Load balancing complexity with sticky sessions
- Browser compatibility considerations (though widely supported now)
- Debugging can be more challenging than HTTP

## Technical Implementation
1. **Connection Management**:
   - JWT authentication during WebSocket handshake
   - Connection pooling and user session tracking
   - Heartbeat/ping-pong for connection health monitoring
   - Graceful handling of disconnections and reconnections

2. **Message Types**:
   ```json
   {
     "type": "score_update",
     "data": {
       "top_10": [...],
       "updated_user": {...}
     }
   }
   
   {
     "type": "connection_status",
     "data": {
       "status": "connected",
       "user_count": 1247
     }
   }
   
   {
     "type": "error",
     "data": {
       "message": "Authentication failed"
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Broadcasting Strategy**:
   - Room-based broadcasting for different leaderboards
   - Selective updates (only affected users)
   - Efficient message serialization
   - Rate limiting to prevent spam

## Scalability Considerations
- WebSocket server clustering with shared state
- Redis pub/sub for cross-server message broadcasting
- Connection load balancing with sticky sessions
- Horizontal scaling of WebSocket servers
- Connection pooling and resource optimization

## Error Handling
- Automatic reconnection logic on client side
- Exponential backoff for reconnection attempts
- Fallback to HTTP polling if WebSocket fails
- Clear error messages and status indicators
- Connection timeout and cleanup procedures

## Security Measures
- JWT validation during WebSocket handshake
- Rate limiting for message frequency
- Input validation for client messages
- CORS configuration for WebSocket connections
- WSS (WebSocket Secure) for encrypted communication

## Monitoring and Observability
- Active connection count tracking
- Message throughput and latency metrics
- Connection drop and reconnection rates
- Error rate monitoring
- Resource usage per connection

## Alternatives Considered
1. **HTTP Long Polling**: Simpler but less efficient
2. **Server-Sent Events (SSE)**: Unidirectional, less flexible
3. **HTTP/2 Server Push**: Not widely supported, limited browser compatibility
4. **Third-party Services (Pusher, Socket.io)**: External dependency and cost

## Browser Compatibility
- Modern browsers have excellent WebSocket support
- Fallback mechanisms for older browsers
- Progressive enhancement approach
- Feature detection on client side

## Testing Strategy
- Load testing with concurrent connections
- Connection stability testing
- Message delivery reliability testing
- Failover and reconnection testing
- Cross-browser compatibility testing
