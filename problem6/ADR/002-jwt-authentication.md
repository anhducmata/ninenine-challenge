# ADR-002: JWT Tokens for Authentication

## Status
Accepted

## Date
2025-07-17

## Context
The live scoreboard system requires secure user authentication that works across multiple services (API Server, WebSocket Server) and provides stateless authentication for scalability.

## Decision
We have decided to use JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for user authentication and authorization across all services.

## Rationale
1. **Stateless**: No need to store session data on the server
2. **Scalable**: Works well with microservices and load balancing
3. **Cross-Service**: Can be validated by any service without database calls
4. **Standard**: Well-established industry standard with good library support
5. **Self-Contained**: Contains user claims and permissions within the token
6. **Performance**: Eliminates database lookups for authentication on each request

## Consequences

### Positive
- Excellent scalability without session storage
- Fast authentication validation
- Works seamlessly with WebSocket connections
- Reduces database load for authentication
- Easy to implement across different services
- Good security when properly implemented

### Negative
- Token revocation is challenging (requires blacklist or short expiration)
- Larger payload compared to session IDs
- Clock synchronization requirements for expiration
- Sensitive data in tokens needs careful handling
- Token refresh mechanism needed for long sessions

## Security Considerations
- Use strong signing algorithms (RS256 or HS256)
- Implement reasonable expiration times (15-30 minutes)
- Add refresh token mechanism for better UX
- Include essential claims only to minimize token size
- Implement token blacklist for immediate revocation if needed
- Use HTTPS for all token transmission

## Implementation Details
```json
{
  "iss": "scoreboard-auth-service",
  "sub": "user-123",
  "aud": "scoreboard-api",
  "exp": 1642694400,
  "iat": 1642690800,
  "claims": {
    "user_id": 123,
    "username": "player1",
    "permissions": ["score_update", "leaderboard_view"]
  }
}
```

## Alternatives Considered
1. **Session-based Authentication**: Traditional but doesn't scale well
2. **OAuth 2.0**: Too complex for our current requirements
3. **API Keys**: Not suitable for user authentication
4. **SAML**: Overkill for this application

## Monitoring
- Track token validation success/failure rates
- Monitor token expiration patterns
- Alert on unusual authentication patterns
- Log security incidents and token misuse attempts
